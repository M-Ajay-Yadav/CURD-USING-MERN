Problem Understanding {#problem-understanding}
Clearly understand the problem you're trying to solve or the task you need to accomplish. Break it down into smaller, manageable components if necessary.

Algorithm Selection {#algorithm-selection}
Choose an appropriate algorithm or approach to solve the problem. Consider factors such as efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.

Pseudocode or Planning {#pseudocode-or-planning}
Write pseudocode or plan out the steps you'll take to implement the algorithm. This helps organize your thoughts before diving into coding.

Implementation {#implementation}
Write the actual code based on your pseudocode or plan. Start with small, incremental steps, testing each part as you go to ensure correctness.

Testing and Debugging {#testing-and-debugging}
Test your code thoroughly to identify any errors or bugs. Use debugging tools and techniques to locate and fix issues.

Optimization {#optimization}
Refactor and optimize your code for efficiency, readability, and maintainability. This may involve improving algorithmic complexity, reducing redundancy, or enhancing code structure.

Documentation {#documentation}
Document your code by adding comments, docstrings, or README files to explain its purpose, functionality, and usage. This helps others understand and use your code effectively.

Version Control {#version-control}
Use version control systems like Git to track changes to your code, collaborate with others, and manage project history.

Review and Iteration {#review-and-iteration}
Review your code with peers or mentors for feedback and suggestions. Iterate on your implementation as needed to address any issues or improve its quality.

Deployment {#deployment}
Deploy your code to the intended environment or platform, ensuring it works correctly and meets the desired requirements.

Maintenance {#maintenance}
Continuously monitor and maintain your code over time, addressing any new issues, adding features, or making improvements as necessary.
